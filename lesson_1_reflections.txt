using Fc in windows or 
diff for Linux 
simplifies comparison of two files.
basically it does comparison automatically 
comapring line by line 
and showing lines that are different. 
that substencially shortens
th bug and typo search time. 
the shorter are your lines the 
more efficient is Diff tool
because it only shows 
the lines that have differences
but does not higlight
the difference itself
